    <h2>About the site</h2>
    <p>Hey, first off thanks for visiting! If you couldn't already tell, this site is built using a straightforward LAMP + Javascript/jQuery stack.</p>

    <p>Sure I could just spin up a wordpress site or use any one of the JS frameworks out there nowadays to build something that looks twice as good in half the time, but I always had a special admiration for building things from scratch. While in my everyday work of course its not only a smart idea, but probably the best idea to stand on the shoulders of giants. But here I wanted to create something that is my own from the bottom up and considered this to be a great learning opportunity to really dig in deep on stuff a lot of frameworks and CMS do for you out of the box.</p>

    <p>I have all sorts of ideas and plans for this site, everything from being the simple resume website it is today, to being a far more robust platoform including;</p>

    <ul>
        <li>An admin panel to update and create the content you're reading right now</li>
        <li>A blog section to post about things I've learned while developing to help others (and so I don't forget!)</li>
        <li>Various calculators for my own shenanigans</li>
        <li>And quite honestly anything else that I happen to find cool and want to learn how to build from the bottom up</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I've always had an interest in Computers since I was a little kid. It always blew my mind how these massively complex machines could run off a simple array of 1's and 0's. I didn't always think I would get into Software Development. When I went to college for the first time I actually went for a Degree in Music Theory and Composition! </p>
    <p>I started as a Software Developer in July, 2016 as an intern at Barefoot Solutions.</p>
